# POD_LSTM_DayMet
POD-based daytime max temperature emulator for NASA DayMet data

# Instructions
1. I have not included numpy data - contact me if you want it and I can set something up for transfer (currently hosted on JLSE). The code expects training data in `Data/`
2. There must be a folder `Coefficients/` where POD followed by truncation generates the training and testing data. 
3. There must be a folder `Visualization/` where contours etc., are generated by the forecasts. 
4. There must be three folders within `Analyses/`: `Analyses/biases/`, `Analyses/pdfs/`, `Analyses/region_masks/` where sub-regions of the North American continent are analysed for statistical accuracy of forecasts.
